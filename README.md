# Daily Auto Commit
This repository demonstrates my ability to automate GitHub workflows using GitHub Actions.
## What it does
- Runs automatically every day at 12:00 UTC
- Updates a log file with the current date and system information
- Fetches a random quote from an API
- **Updates this README with the quote of the day**
- Commits and pushes these changes automatically
## Why I built this
This project showcases my technical abilities with:
- GitHub Actions and CI/CD workflows
- Automation scripts
- Git operations from within workflows
- Working with external APIs
- Dynamic content generation
- *Most importantly, it shows how green boxes really dont mean much in terms of skills.*
## How it works
The GitHub Action workflow:
1. Runs on a schedule (daily)
2. Fetches a random inspirational quote
3. Updates both a log file and this README
4. Commits and pushes the changes
